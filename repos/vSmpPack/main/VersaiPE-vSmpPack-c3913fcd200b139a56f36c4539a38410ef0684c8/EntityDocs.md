### Bosses

##### Ogre

The ogre will be a boss that is lower tiered, it will drop
some basic level loot along with `Basic Rune` and other low tier items.

###### More Bosses will be added soon

### Neatural

None yet as I feel this should be something that we can ask the staff
team what they think should be added, and what they think would be cool ideas.

### Hostile

#### Goblin

The goblin will be the beginning of the SMP, it will drop some very basic items
it is similar to the Baby Zombie, but will be summoned by the Ogre boss in battles.
These will also spawn in the caves and the dungeon's.
