Code Standards at Versai

At Versai, we aim to maintain high-quality code that is readable, maintainable, and efficient. This document outlines the coding standards and best practices that all contributors to Versai's codebase should follow.

Skidding

Skidding is allowed in the codebase, as long as it is used in moderation and does not compromise the code's readability, maintainability, or efficiency. Skidding can provide a quick and efficient solution to a particular problem, but it should be avoided when a more readable and maintainable solution is possible.

Naming Conventions

All variables, functions, and class names should be descriptive and written in camelCase.
Constants should be written in UPPER_CASE.
Indentation

Indentation should be consistent throughout the codebase, with a recommended tab size of 4 spaces.
Code Formatting

Lines should be limited to a maximum of 100 characters.
Spaces should be used to separate operators and to align assignment statements.
Comments

Comments should be used to explain the purpose of code and to describe any non-obvious algorithms or logic.
Comments should be written in clear and concise English.
Testing

All code changes should be accompanied by appropriate unit tests to ensure the code's functionality and to prevent regressions.

By following these code standards, we can ensure the high quality and maintainability of the codebase. If you have any questions or concerns about these standards, please reach out to the development team.
