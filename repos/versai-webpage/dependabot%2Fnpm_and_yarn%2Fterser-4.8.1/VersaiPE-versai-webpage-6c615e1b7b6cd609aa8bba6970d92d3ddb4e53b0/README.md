# Versai Webpage

I am making this website with multiple features such as player search so that people can go on and login and then search the stats of other player that have logged into the server. Logging in is using MSAL auto with Microsoft. Some features im hopefully going to be adding are as followed:

- [ ] Player Skin fetcher

<h6>Fetch the skin, and then get just the head portion and put it in the player search</h6>

- [ ] Player Stats fetcher

<h6>Kills - Deaths - KDR - Rank - Daily kills - Daily deaths - Daily KDR - Monthly Kills - Monthly Deaths - Monthly KDR - Online time</h6>

- [ ] Player Auth

<h6>Player auth will be done because using MSAL login property <code>username</code> returns the email address. I will have to have a plugin that can communicate with the server and when the player logs in they can do <code>/link</code> or something and it will give them a code such as <code>12keao3</code> that they can enter to link to there account. Im not sure how I would link the 2 together though</h6>

- [ ] Server Info and Stats

<h6>This will show the following *hopefully* <code>TPS - Online players / Max players - Status [ online | offline | whitelisted ] - online player names</code></h6>
