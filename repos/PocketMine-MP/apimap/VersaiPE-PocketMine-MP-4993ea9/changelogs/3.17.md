**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.200**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.17.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.200.
- Removed compatibility with earlier versions.

## Known issues (please don't open issues for these)
- Walls don't connect to each other
- Pumpkin and melon stems may not connect to their corresponding pumpkin/melon
- New blocks, items & mobs aren't implemented
- Nether doesn't exist

# 3.17.1
- Fixed some instances of plugin-caused crashes not being detected (eval()'d code, custom plugin paths).
- Server uptime is now included in crash reports.
- Hoes now take damage when used to break sponges.
- Using lava as fuel in a furnace now leaves behind an empty bucket.

# 3.17.2
- Fixed region header corruption when chunks with larger-than-expected lengths are found. These chunks are now treated as corrupted, instead of automatically attempting to salvage them (which usually fails anyway).
- `RegionLoader->removeChunk()` now allows the space used by the removed chunk to be reused by future region saves.
- Extracted `Living->applyConsumptionResults()` from `Living->consumeObject()` (preparation for a future bug fix).

# 3.17.3
- Improved performance of chunk loading in Region-based worlds.
- Improved performance of region header validation in Region-based worlds (indirect improvement to chunk loading performance).
- Fixed some PHP 8.0 language-level compatibility issues.
- Source installations will now exit with an error when Composer dependencies are not in sync with the current Git revision. Now, it's required to run `composer install` after every git pull to make sure the correct dependency versions are installed.

# 3.17.4
- Removed `readline` support. This hasn't been maintained for many years, never worked correctly, and isn't thread-safe in any case.
- Fixed false-positives of region corruption in Region-based worlds (outdated file stat cache).
- Fixed more deprecation warnings on PHP 8.0 (optional parameter before required).
- `CraftItemEvent->getInputs()` now returns a list starting at offset 0, instead of random offsets. (Note that the contents still won't be ordered.)
- `CraftItemEvent->getOutputs()` now returns a list starting at offset 0, instead of random offsets. (Note that the contents still won't be ordered.)
- Fixed a bug that broke synchronized building, bridging, towering and more.
- Objects in memory dumps no longer show inherited properties multiple times.
