**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.20**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.15.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.20.
- Removed compatibility with 1.16.0.

## Known issues (please don't open issues for these)
- Walls don't connect to each other
- Pumpkin and melon stems may not connect to their corresponding pumpkin/melon
- New blocks, items & mobs aren't implemented

# 3.15.1
- Fixed various PHP 7.4 compatibility issues in Composer dependencies (primarily callback-validator).
- Fixed LevelDB worlds with corrupted `level.dat` crashing the server instead of failing gracefully.
- Fixed error spam when using strings for layers in flatworld presets (`e.g. bedrock,3xdirt,grass`).
- Fixed blocks not getting updated properly on explosions.
- Fixed `BlockGrowEvent` not being called when sugarcane grows.
- Potato crops now drop poisonous potatoes when harvested.
- Fixed the wrong number of potatoes being dropped when harvesting potato crops.
- Players no longer get pullbacks when sprinting on slabs, stairs and various other blocks when `player.anti-cheat.allow-movement-cheats` is set to `false`. (This bug has been around for over 5 years, so many of you will be used to its existence.)
- Fixed entity collision box calculation not taking clip distance into account.
- Entities now step up the correct height of the target block, instead of jumping into the air 0.6 blocks and falling back down.
