So here we go working on gangs, maybe one of the hardest things that ive ever undertaken, in my whole programing career, along
with the fact that it is with a whole diffrent API then I am used to. This document here is to adkowledge all that i want to happen
come of these things are going to be somewhat hard to implement. and some of them may not be implemented at all. but here we go...
