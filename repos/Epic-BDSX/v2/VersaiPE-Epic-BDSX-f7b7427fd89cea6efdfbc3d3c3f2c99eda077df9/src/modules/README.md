# Potential Modules for Versai

Note, I'll be discussing with Duo on potentials modules to add, currently we are already working on ranks and have home implemented, but we can expand (or incorporated into other) these features into modules

# Shortlist
- TPA
- Warps
- Claims (Similar to factions, but solely for protection against griefing)
- Combat Logger
- Event Logger (block break, place, chat, leave, join, etc)
- Esoteric (for pvp AND toolbox, singleplayer cheats)
